Contributing
------------

[shell prompt]$ vim <file>.tex
[shell prompt]$ git add <file>.tex
[shell prompt]$ git commit -m 'comment your changes'
[shell prompt]$ git push

Note: a/ to be able to push to the remote repository you need to send your
ssh public key to <lebrungd@neo.tamu.edu>
Copy and paste the content of the file ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
If it doesn't exist, do a
[shell prompt]$ ssh-keygen -t rsa
If you still don't get it you're hopeless...
Call (979)422-7165 and see with Bruno :)

b/ for those working under Windows, see http://book.git-scm.com/6_git_on_windows.html and ask Jean for some hints.
