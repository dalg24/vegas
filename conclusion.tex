\section*{CONCLUSION}
\vspace{-4mm}
Adaptive $hp$-FEM has been efficiently applied to a two-dimensional nonlinear coupled neutronics/heat conduction problem.  The convergence of $hp$-FEM to the exact solution was found to be exponential on a log-log scale (whereas $h$-FEM converges only algebraically).
%
Future work will include (a) treatment of multi-group neutron diffusion with delayed neutron precursors and (b) implementation of higher-order methods for the time discretization.
