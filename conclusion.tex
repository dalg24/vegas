\section*{CONCLUSION}
Adaptive $hp$-FEM has been efficiently applied to a two-dimensional nonlinear coupled neutronics/heat conduction problem.  The convergence to the exact solution was found to be exponential on a log-log scale.

Future work includes (a) treatment of multi-group neutron diffusion with delayed neutron precurors and (b) implementation of higher-order methods for the time discretization.
