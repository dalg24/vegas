The accuracy and convergence of numerical models can be established by using simplified problems for which analytical solutions are available.  However, for time-dependent coupled multiphysics problems, analytical solutions are more intricate to obtain and we need to resort to the Method of Manufactured Solutions (MMS) \cite{roache2002} for such problems.

The basic philosophy behind the MMS is that an exact solution, with enough smoothness in space and time, is chosen and substituted into the partial differential equation (PDE) to obtain a suitable forcing function (i.e., right-hand-side of the PDE) that is employed in the numerical simulation.  Therefore, the numerical solution can be compared to the exact solution (in a given norm) and provide a measure of the error.  This procedure can be applied to nonlinear and coupled physics problems and is an useful tool for code verification purposes.
