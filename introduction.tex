Typically, the accuracy and convergence of numerical models are established by using simplified problems for which analytical solutions are available. For time-dependent coupled multiphysics problems, analytical solutions are more difficult to obtain and we need to resort to the Method of Manufactured Solutions (MMS) \cite{roache2002}. The MMS can be used to analyze and prove code correctness.

The basic philosophy behind MMS is that an exact solution Uref with enough smoothness in space and time is chosen and substituted into the PDE to obtain a suitable forcing function (i.e., right-hand-side of the PDE) that is employed in the numerical simulation. Therefore, the numerically obtained values can be compared to the exact ones, providing a measure of the error. This procedure can be applied to nonlinear and coupled physics problems and is an useful tool for code verification purposes.

A new C++ library for adaptive hp-FEM currently is currently under active development at the University of Nevada, Reno \cite{solin2010}.   The exponential convergence makes the method a very attractive choice for solving multiphysics PDE systems.  In collaboration with the hp-FEM group at Reno, Texas A\&M University is
